- It's better to rename your variable for more depth&organized reversing.
- Don't be affraid to click on memory variables and look throught their memory address.
It helped me a lot to figure out which memory indexes should I look for.
## C Syntax
```
(int)input # Access input integer value: 'f' == 66
```
